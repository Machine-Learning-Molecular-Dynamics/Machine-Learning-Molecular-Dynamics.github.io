===============

Installing *mlmd* is easy, the first step is to download (clone) the 
code from its site in github `https://github.com/zeledon14/mlmd <https://github.com/zeledon14/mlmd>`_
To download the code use the command: ::

	git clone https://github.com/zeledon14/mlmd.git
	
To install *mlmd* go inside the **mlmd** directory just downloaded. 
Inside the **mlmd** directory there are other three directories (mlmd, 
scripts, and testing_data), and two files (READ.md, and setup.py). 
Inside the **mlmd** directory containing setup.py execute: ::

	python setup.py install --record mlmd_uninstall.txt
	
That's it *mlmd* is installed. The *mlmd_uninstall.txt* stores the 
installation record of *mlmd* in case future uninstallation.
